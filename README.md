# Sustainable-Development-Goals-Text-Classification-Challenge
This is work that is related to Zindi competition https://zindi.africa/competitions/sustainable-development-goals-sdgs-text-classification-challenge/leaderboard. The The goal is to classify text content by its relevance to the measurable indicators of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal #3 – Health and Well-Being. Each SDG has several “targets”, or social outcomes that the UN hopes to achieve by 2030. Each of these targets is measured using a set of indicators. These indicators represent the quantitative measurements that will be used to judge whether each SDG target has been achieved or not by 2030. SDG 3 has 14 targets and 27 indicators. The challenge of this competition will be to create a classifier that labels text content by the 27 SDG 3 indicators that are most “relevant.” The training data for this challenge includes approximately 3,000 web-scraped text from tenders, programs, and documents, as well as news articles about international development and humanitarian aid, and finally text descriptions of organizations involved in those sectors.
